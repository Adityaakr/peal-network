## What this is
Reveal-later encryption network ("seal now. reveal on cue.") on commonware's
batched threshold encryption. Built end to end 2026-07-06/07, phases 0-8 all
green. Contract: `spec/index.md`. Status + gates: `PROGRESS.md`, `REPORT.md`.

## Architecture (verified)
- `crates/bte-crypto` is the ONLY crate touching group elements; it wraps
  simple-bte pinned at git rev `147a0878` (Cargo.toml workspace dep). Payload
  path is the FO module (`fo.rs`), NOT the Schnorr/G_T path — see
  spec/API-MAP.md for the exact function map.
- Coordinator: axum /v0 + rusqlite (single Mutex<Connection>), engine tick
  500ms (`engine.rs:tick`), cross-terms cached in memory, recomputed after
  restart (`finalize_batch`).
- Nodes: outbound-only pollers, argon2id+ChaCha20 keystores
  (`bte-node/src/keystore.rs`).
- SDK: wasm inlined as base64 (`packages/sdk/scripts/build.mjs`), two wasm
  chunks (seal / verify). Anchor helpers are dependency-free (precomputed
  selectors, raw eth_call).

## Invariants (do not break)
- Positions: real cts sort by ct_hash, dummies fill the tail — a pure
  function of the real ct set (invariant 6 test).
- Wire types all start `BTE0` + type byte; golden files in
  `crates/bte-crypto/tests/golden/` (regenerate only with BTE_BLESS=1 and a
  version bump).
- KEM header and shares are exactly 48 bytes (tested).
- `/v0/reveals/:id` must 404 before reveal (invariant 4 test greps the db
  for plaintext bytes).
- Rejected shares are stored flagged and NEVER count toward t.

## Gotchas (hard-won)
- ark-std 0.6 re-exports rand 0.8; simple-bte also deps rand 0.9 (unused by
  its lib API). Use `bte_crypto::rand` / `bte_crypto::os_rng()` downstream —
  never a direct rand dep (version split bites).
- wasm builds need `.cargo/config.toml` cfg `getrandom_backend="wasm_js"`
  (getrandom 0.3 via rand 0.9) AND getrandom 0.2 "js" feature.
- Docker runtime user needs /data + /ceremony chown'd in the image (named
  volumes inherit image ownership).
- pnpm 11 blocks build scripts; `allowBuilds: esbuild: true` in
  pnpm-workspace.yaml.
- Shell cwd persists between Bash calls in this harness; watch relative paths.
- Piping `just …` through `tail` masks exit codes — verify demo results via
  API state, not pipe tails.

## Docs
- Standalone protocol article: docs/protocol.html (self-contained HTML, brand
  tokens inline, SVG architecture diagram). Same content spine as #/protocol;
  update BOTH when the protocol or SDK surface changes.
- Code-side deep-dive: docs/how-peal-is-built.html (self-contained HTML, Inter +
  JetBrains Mono, brand tokens inline, hand-authored SVG architecture diagram).
  Teaches the whole build crate-by-crate: bte-crypto (7-fn lifecycle), engine
  state machine, node/keystore, wasm bridge, SDK, merkle+anchor, trust trade-offs.
  Grounded 2026-07-08 in lib.rs/engine.rs/api.rs/merkle.rs/node/cli/wasm/sdk.
  Keep in sync when the crate surface or trust model changes.
- In-app protocol reference at #/protocol (packages/explorer/src/pages/protocol.ts,
  nav in index.html): overview, use cases, lifecycle, cryptography (wire, FO,
  punctured setup, pipelined recovery, merkle commitment), private seals,
  architecture, production posture, integration (incl. tags), trust model.
  Grounded in spec/index.md + engine.rs/merkle.rs; keep in sync when the
  protocol or SDK surface changes. Styles live under .protocol-* in style.css.
  Restyled 2026-07-08 to match the philosophy design system: Josefin Sans
  400/500 headings, DM Sans body, hairline section separators, scroll-reveal
  motion on header + all sections via the shared src/reveal.ts helper
  (mountScrollReveal; .scroll-reveal/.is-visible classes in style.css).
- Landing page at #/ (packages/explorer/src/pages/landing.ts): light centered
  hero (Josefin/DM Sans, soft sky gradient), "Seal now. / Reveal on cue."
  headline, a seal-prompt pill that hands off to #/app, dark/light pill CTAs,
  and the real app screenshot (public/app-preview.png, regenerate by
  screenshotting peal.network/#/app at 2000px) in a CSS browser frame rising
  from the fold. Staggered blur-fade entrance. The EXPLORER moved to #/app
  (main.ts routes; unknown hashes still fall through to the explorer).
  body.landing-page hides the standard site header and unclamps main.
  History: v1 Spline 3D hero, v2 HLS video hero (both replaced 2026-07-08).
- Philosophy manifesto at #/philosophy (packages/explorer/src/pages/philosophy.ts,
  route in main.ts, sole visible header nav link — network/protocol/code links
  are hidden in index.html, 2026-07-08 user request). Copy is user-authored
  verbatim (epigraph + 6 tenets + "what this unlocks" + "seal now. reveal on
  cue." sign-off). Redesigned 2026-07-08 per user: sentence-case grammar
  (capitals restored), Josefin Sans 300-500 headings ("not too bold"), DM Sans
  body (both via Google Fonts in index.html), centered header, 64px numeral
  gutter, hairline tenet separators, scroll-reveal motion (blur 14px + rise +
  fade, 700ms ease-out; above-fold blocks stagger in on load 110ms apart,
  below-fold via IntersectionObserver; reduced-motion shows all instantly).
  Styles under .philosophy-* in style.css. NOTE: this page intentionally
  deviates from brand.md typography (Satoshi/Inter) at user request.

## Decision log
- 2026-07-07: product renamed OPEN then Peal (peal.network) same day;
  explorer is "Peal Explorer", identity "the guaranteed reveal network",
  headline "commit-reveal without the second transaction.", speed line "add
  fair reveals to your dapp in minutes." Display strings only (brand.md
  Naming section); bte-* crates, bte-sdk, /v0 API, BTE0 wire magic unchanged.
- 2026-07-07: private seals: AES-128-GCM layer over capsule payloads, key in
  the share-link fragment only (packages/explorer/src/privacy.ts, BTEP1 wire
  prefix). Default ON for time capsules; bids/votes stay public by design.
- 2026-07-07: FO transform as DEM + CCA (spec allowed it; DEVIATIONS #1/#2).
- 2026-07-07: per-slot validity via bandwidth-optimized hints `[k_i]_1==ct0`
  (public API only) so mauled cts never poison a batch.
- 2026-07-07: revealRoot tx sent by key-holder script, coordinator stays
  chain-free (DEVIATIONS #6).
- 2026-07-07: explorer needed hand-rolled CORS in api.rs (no new deps).

## Frontend (playground, 2026-07-07)
- Explorer is a playground: seal in-browser via bte-sdk wasm (packages/explorer/src/playground.ts),
  live share dots from `verified_shares` per batch (api.rs get_condition), reveal flip.
- brand.md at repo root is the design source of truth (white, Satoshi, #2563eb, sentence case, no em-dashes).
- SDK gotcha FIXED: `fetch` must be bound to globalThis (bare reference = Illegal invocation in browsers).
- Dockerfile.web builds the pnpm workspace in 3 stages (wasm-pack -> pnpm -> caddy); .dockerignore added.
- Browser e2e pattern: playwright script in scratchpad drives seal->reveal with screenshots; port 8080
  may be held by the user's other projects (cusp-fi vite) — use a compose port override (18080) for tests.

## Condition tags + round segregation (2026-07-07)
- conditions carry an optional `tag` TEXT column (db.rs schema + ALTER
  migration in db.rs open()); create_condition validates <=32 chars of
  [a-z0-9:_-] (api.rs); returned by list/get. SDK condition() takes tag.
- Playground tags: `round:bid`, `round:vote` (shared, joinable), `capsule`
  (never joined). findOpenRound(tag) matches tag exactly — untagged/legacy
  conditions are never joined (playground.ts). Round length: first sealer's
  #pg-round-secs select (30s..1h) sets it; joiners inherit.
- INVARIANT: never join a condition whose tag you did not create for that
  purpose — joining someone's capsule strands the entry until the capsule
  fires (the original bug).

## Dummy padding (mapped 2026-07-07)
- WHY: B=64 is baked into the ceremony CRS (punctured powers-of-tau, FFT domain,
  spec/index.md:32,39-42); every batch MUST be exactly B slots, so the
  coordinator pads with self-sealed dummies at freeze (engine.rs:135-143).
- Each dummy is a REAL FO ciphertext sealing "BTE_DUMMY_V0:" + 16 random bytes
  (bte-crypto/src/lib.rs:449-455); unique ct_hash per batch; committed in the
  merkle root with all slots (engine.rs:407-430); operators do real work on them.
- Reveal API exposes per slot ONLY: position, ct_hash, is_dummy, valid,
  payload_b64 (engine.rs:19-25, api.ts:50-56). Dummy rows are visually
  identical except position/hash — the expandable 63-row table in
  condition.ts boardTable duplicates what the slot grid already shows.
- Classification logic (corrupt/dummy/private/real) is duplicated between
  slotGrid (condition.ts:211-219) and slotRow (condition.ts:234-245).

## Share-link recipient flow (mapped 2026-07-07)
- Link format: `${origin}${pathname}#/s/<conditionId>/<ctHash>` (packages/explorer/src/playground.ts:70);
  router regex requires exact 64-hex ctHash (packages/explorer/src/main.ts:16).
- Recipient page packages/explorer/src/pages/seal-view.ts: 2s status poll + 1s countdown tick
  (seal-view.ts:99-100); reveal detected purely by `status === 'revealed'` (seal-view.ts:69), then
  getReveal + slot match by ct_hash (seal-view.ts:75).
- Deployment: hash routes never reach the server; Caddy is static try_files fallback
  (docker/Caddyfile:11-15) so per-link OG previews are impossible without a server route.
- Coordinator: CORS `*` (api.rs:70), rate limit 50 rps / 400 burst per IP (state.rs:16) — polling
  is a non-issue. NO push machinery anywhere (no WS/SSE/webhook/email); only pull. The one hook
  point for future push is the reveal write in engine.rs finalize_ready.
- Engagement primitives ABSENT (all confirmed by grep): document.title never updated, no
  favicon/OG/manifest in index.html, no service worker/Notification API, no localStorage
  (no "my seals" persistence), no visibilitychange handling (background tabs throttle the
  2s poll to ~1/min, so "opens by itself" is unreliable when hidden), no sender name/label
  (conditions table has no creator/memo column, db.rs:16-25; kicker hardcoded seal-view.ts:13).

## Social / OG link cards — feasibility (mapped 2026-07-09)
- ASK: show a LIVE ticking reveal timer inside an X/Twitter link preview when a Peal link is pasted.
- EXTERNAL VERDICT: impossible on X. In-timeline cards are a static image (twitter:image/og:image,
  JPG/PNG/WebP; GIF flattened to first frame; NO JS/video/animation; Twitterbot doesn't run JS).
  Best achievable = a dynamic PNG "reveals in Xh Ym" SNAPSHOT frozen at scrape time; X caches it
  ~7 days and doesn't re-scrape on a schedule, so it can go stale (show a card that reads sanely
  after the reveal too). Live in-feed refresh is a Farcaster Frame capability, not X.
- CURRENT STATE: pure Vite SPA, no SSR/edge. Single static index.html for all routes
  (docker/Caddyfile try_files → /index.html). Meta tags are global + static in
  packages/explorer/index.html:6-13 — has og:title/description + `twitter:card=summary` (not
  large_image) and NO og:image/twitter:image at all. No OG-image/screenshot/satori/resvg code
  anywhere (grep-confirmed). Coordinator serves JSON only under /v0.
- STRUCTURAL BLOCKER (the real one): all shareable ids live in the URL FRAGMENT (after `#`),
  which scrapers never receive. Router is hash-based (main.ts:13-38). Share link builder
  `sealLink()` playground.ts:92-95 → `…#/s/<conditionId>/<ctHash>/<shareKey>`. So an edge/scraper
  literally can't tell which seal a link points to.
- PRIVACY CONSTRAINT: the trailing `<shareKey>` fragment segment is the AES-128-GCM decryption key
  (privacy.ts:26-38, "travels ONLY in the hash fragment, never sent to any server"). Moving seal
  identifiers to a server-visible path to enable OG would LEAK the key. Per-SEAL private-capsule OG
  is therefore off the table by design.
- WHAT IS ACHIEVABLE: a per-CONDITION snapshot card. The condition id is PUBLIC (shown on home list,
  GET /v0/conditions/:id) and the countdown source `fires_at` (unix secs) is available server-side
  (db.rs:20, returned api.rs:265; NULL for at_block conditions — no absolute time). REQUIRES:
  (1) a server-visible id — new path/query like `/c/<id>` or `?c=<id>` (not just `#/condition/<id>`);
  (2) an edge/serverless renderer (none today) that reads fires_at and renders a PNG; (3) per-request
  <head> meta injection for that route. This is net-new infra, not a tweak.
- No "share to X"/intent UI exists today; only a "copy share link" button (playground.ts:653,788).

## Decision log
- 2026-07-08 (prism-plan): next-phase direction = "earn the network thesis on ONE
  painkiller." Refuted BOTH extremes: (a) traction-first on agent track records while
  deferring DKG (3/3 adversarial skeptics refuted: trusted dealer is an INTEGRITY break
  for a trust product, not a low-harm caveat; near-term demand is a mirage; the deferral
  gate is circular), and (b) solo multi-month DKG with no user (round-1 lenses). Plan =
  3 parallel tracks: (1) remove single-dealer trust hole de-risked (investigate multi-party
  SETUP CEREMONY as lighter alt to full DKG; get grant / commonware co-dev / open-source
  help), (2) validate ONE painkiller = sealed-bid/dark-block sealed order flow sold as a
  dedicated committee, with an 8-week demand kill-criterion (NOT agent records = vitamin),
  (3) cheap finishers: Sepolia run, npm publish, Railway cleanup. Token ($PEAL/$sPEAL) LAST;
  $sPEAL = highest reg risk. Full doc: docs/plans/001-peal-next-plan.md.
- Chain (grounded 2026-07-08): EIP-2537 BLS12-381 precompile is LIVE on ETH mainnet
  (Pectra) so Stage-2 on-chain verify is buildable on ETH today; Solana BLS12-381 =
  SIMD-0388, pending devnet (Agave v4.0.0-beta) + mainnet, so Solana anchor tier works now
  but on-chain verify is not yet available to programs.

## INVARIANT (2026-07-08)
- Peal's whole value is trust-minimization, so the SINGLE-TRUSTED-DEALER ceremony
  (bte-cli samples tau in one process, lib.rs:192-233) negates the value prop for EVERY
  serious use, including "low-value" reputational ones. Do not market "reveal-later
  encryption / tau is gone" or onboard any real-value or trust-selling product until the
  single-dealer hole is removed (setup ceremony or DKG). It is a launch-blocker, not a
  caveat.

## INVARIANT (2026-07-12): the deadline is NOT enforced, it is asserted
- SECOND trust hole, distinct from the single-dealer one above and NOT documented in
  spec/index.md (which only names the dealer at line 15) or #/protocol (which says "the
  cue fires: wall clock or block height" without saying WHOSE clock).
- at_time: the ONLY thing gating a reveal is `fires_at <= unix_now()` in the coordinator's
  own process (engine.rs:29-39, db.rs:85 SystemTime::now). Nothing else checks it.
- OPERATORS NEVER CHECK A CLOCK. bte-node polls /v0/work, decodes the 48-byte headers it is
  handed, calls partial(), posts the share (node/src/main.rs:150-193). It never reads
  fires_at, never fetches the condition, never looks at a clock or chain. It signs whatever
  it is given. /v0/work does not even filter on status='frozen' — only "a batch row exists
  and is not finalized" (api.rs:377-379).
- CONSEQUENCE: t-of-n buys NOTHING on timing. It only stops the coordinator decrypting with
  ZERO cooperation, and cooperation is free — a compromised/buggy coordinator inserts a batch
  row and t honest nodes cheerfully reveal a capsule whose deadline is a week out.
- at_block is WEAKER, not stronger: one unauthenticated `eth_blockNumber` POST (engine.rs:97-113)
  read by the coordinator alone. Takes the LATEST head at face value (no finalized tag, no
  confirmations, no block hash, no reorg handling, no second source). freeze is irreversible,
  so a reorg or a lying RPC = permanent early reveal. It ADDS a trusted party (the RPC) without
  removing the coordinator. NOT running a node — just reqwest posting one JSON-RPC method.
  No RPC configured for a chain id => condition stays pending FOREVER, silently (engine.rs:75-77).
- Honest guarantee ladder today: (1) no reveal without t shares — CRYPTO. (2) operators only
  share after the deadline — NOTHING. (3) revealed payloads match what was committed — merkle
  root, if anchored. (4) ciphertext existed before block N — chain, if commit() was called.
- TO CLOSE IT (both halves required, either alone is useless): (a) node evaluates the condition
  itself before partial()ing — /v0/work returns kind/fires_at/height and the node refuses until
  ITS OWN clock/RPC agrees; AND (b) the condition record must be immutable + identical for every
  operator, else a malicious coordinator just tells each node a different fires_at — so sign the
  condition at creation under a key nodes pin, or publish conditionId=>fires_at on-chain.
  THE DEADLINE IS THE ONE PROTOCOL INPUT THAT LIVES ONLY IN THE COORDINATOR'S SQLITE FILE.

## Railway persistence — SOLVED 2026-07-12 (do not regress)
- ROOT CAUSE of "every deploy wipes all conditions": /bte-state was a bare `mkdir` in the image
  (Dockerfile.railway:60) with NO volume. Railway gives each deploy a fresh container fs, so
  /bte-state came back empty every time. That empties bte.db (start-railway.sh:10) AND deletes
  ceremony/params.bin, which trips the `if [ ! -f ... ]` guard (start-railway.sh:27) and RE-RUNS
  THE TRUSTED-DEALER CEREMONY => brand-new committee id. Old conditions weren't just hidden, they
  became permanently unrevealable (their committee's operator keys no longer exist anywhere).
- FIX (applied): Railway volume mounted at `/bte-state` on the bte-explorer service. Volumes are
  DASHBOARD-ONLY (not expressible in railway.json) and are created from the PROJECT CANVAS
  (Cmd+K / right-click canvas), NOT the service Settings tab — Settings search for "volume"
  finds nothing, which is what made this hard to find.
- The mount path MUST equal STATE_DIR in docker/start-railway.sh:7 (`${BTE_STATE_DIR:-/bte-state}`).
  Change one without the other and the ceremony re-runs and orphans every seal.
- VERIFIED 2026-07-12: committee 2d7ce50d097b08665ceab77f735967bc45e0a1179803d76fec50f445b8738f9b
  (created_at 1783801633) survived a redeploy unchanged => ceremony skipped => volume holding.
  THE PERSISTENCE TEST IS: `curl -sS https://peal.adibuilds.in/v0/committees` before and after a
  deploy. Same id = good. New id = state was wiped. A fresh committee id is ALSO what a broken
  volume looks like, so one deploy alone proves nothing — you need the id to survive a SECOND one.
- Attaching the volume cost a one-time reset: committee c36dec96 + 21 conditions were lost. This
  was unavoidable (the volume starts empty, so the ceremony ran once more into it).
- WHAT WOULD STILL WIPE IT: deleting/detaching the volume; changing the mount path; deleting and
  recreating the service; setting BTE_STATE_DIR to anything but /bte-state.
- NOW-PERMANENT RISKS (previously masked by the constant wipes): the 5 operator keystores now sit
  on that volume encrypted with the DEFAULT passphrase `railway-devnet-v0` (start-railway.sh:9,
  BTE_KEYSTORE_PASS unset on the service) which is hardcoded in a public repo; and there is NO
  BACKUP — one SQLite file on one volume, lose it and every seal is unrevealable forever.
- docs/deploy-railway.md IS STALE: it describes a 7-service topology (1 coordinator + 5 nodes +
  1 web, private networking) and claims root railway.json targets Dockerfile.web. The LIVE shape
  is the all-in-one Dockerfile.railway (coordinator + in-container ceremony + 5 nodes + Caddy in
  ONE container, start-railway.sh). The doc never mentions the volume at all — the exact gap that
  cost the 21 conditions. bte-sdk / bte-examples / bte-demo-* are a library and scripts, NOT
  servers; only bte-explorer needs a domain (Caddy proxies /v0 -> localhost:8090, Caddyfile:6-14).

## Landing prompt -> capsule handoff (2026-07-12)
- The hero prompt used to DISCARD what the visitor typed (landing.ts just set location.hash),
  despite a comment claiming it "rides the hash into the app" — so they answered "what should
  stay sealed?" twice, once on the hero and again at the playground's #pg-secret.
- Now: landing.ts stashes the trimmed text via putSealDraft(); playground.ts calls takeSealDraft()
  right after renderFields(), selects the time-capsule tab, prefills #pg-secret, focuses it, and
  scrolls it into view.
- The draft rides sessionStorage (packages/explorer/src/draft.ts), NOT the URL: the text is the
  user's SECRET, and the hash would persist it in browser history and in any copied link. Cleared
  on read so a reload never resurrects it. Landing input capped at maxlength=200 to match #pg-secret.
- Reveal timing still defaults to 60s on arrival from the landing page (may be wrong for someone
  sealing a launch date — open question).

## Open items
- Remote IS live now: github.com/Adityaakr/peal-network (main deploys to Railway ->
  peal.adibuilds.in). Supersedes the old "no GitHub remote yet" note.
- Live devnet has NO chain contact: SEPOLIA_RPC_URL is unset on the service, so every condition
  actually firing today is at_time on the coordinator's wall clock. fire_at_block is dead code in
  prod until an RPC is configured.
- Sepolia run of the anchored demo pending SEPOLIA_RPC_URL +
  funded ANCHOR_PRIVATE_KEY (anvil path verified).
- Set BTE_KEYSTORE_PASS on the Railway service (currently the public default) and get a backup
  story for the /bte-state volume — both are now permanent risks, see the persistence section.
- Harden start-railway.sh: a missing params.bin is treated as "first boot, run the ceremony" when
  it actually means "the volume is gone and I am about to orphan every seal". Should fail loudly.
- Rewrite docs/deploy-railway.md to match the live all-in-one shape + the required volume.
- Public devnet: DEVNET_URL in the SDK is a placeholder
  (`https://devnet.bte.invalid`); update when a devnet exists + set the
  playground URL in docs/launch.md.
- Explorer: agent-built and gate-verified; do one human visual pass.

## Encrypted mempool: feasibility + the /encrypted-mempool playground (2026-07-12)

Measured, not guessed. `crates/bte-crypto/examples/mempool_scaling.rs` (n=5, t=3,
200-byte payloads, single thread, laptop):

| B | seal/tx | partial (per op) | pre_decrypt | combine+finalize |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 64 | 0.41 ms | 1.1 ms | 228 ms | 35 ms |
| 256 | 0.41 ms | 3.0 ms | 1.12 s | 143 ms |
| 512 | 0.41 ms | 5.3 ms | 2.49 s | 290 ms |

- An operator does ~5 ms of work and emits a 48-byte share to open a 512-tx
  batch. That is the pitch, and it holds.
- `pre_decrypt` needs only ciphertexts + params, so it starts the moment the
  builder fixes an ordering and overlaps the publish + collect-shares round
  trip. Only `combine + finalize` is on the critical path. B=256 on a 2s L2
  fits today.
- Differentiator vs Shutter: epoch keys OVER-DECRYPT (the released key opens
  every tx encrypted to that epoch, included or not). BTE opens exactly the
  committed batch. That is the CGPP motivation and it is true at Stage 0.

BLOCKER, unresolved: setup. A mempool needs Shamir shares of tau^1..tau^n with
nobody knowing tau. That is not a standard DKG (the secret is STRUCTURED, powers
of tau) - it is an MPC over a product of contributions. Ethereum's KZG ceremony
solves the public-powers half only. Answer this BEFORE committing a mempool
roadmap: if it is intractable, "decentralized operator committee on the roadmap"
(already on the landing page) is a promise that cannot be kept.

Why the mempool is the right THESIS but the wrong NEXT COMMIT: for the
leaderboard, guaranteed reveal is the product and secrecy is a bonus, so Stage 0
ships honestly. A mempool INVERTS that - secrecy IS the product and an early read
is money, so the trusted dealer / one-container operators / unverified cue stop
being caveats and become the product being a lie. Also ~10 buyers, all courted
(Shutter, BuilderNet, Radius, Espresso), each a 6-18 month integration sale.

### The playground (SHIPPED): `#/encrypted-mempool`
The one artifact in this direction that is honest at Stage 0, because a demo has
no money, so the trust hole costs nothing. Hold this line exactly:
- SIMULATED: pool, searcher, block. `src/mempool/amm.ts`, constant-product.
- REAL: the seal (wasm, live committee params), the batch, the cue, and the
  reveal. The right-hand fill executes on plaintext read back out of
  `/v0/reveals`, NOT from a local variable. Verified: two tabs land in the SAME
  batch (2 real ciphertexts + 62 padding) and each recovers its own slot.
- The page states the trust gap in `.mp-trust` rather than hiding it.

KEY MODELLING RESULT (do not regress): a sandwich is bounded by the VICTIM'S
SLIPPAGE TOLERANCE, not the searcher's appetite. The searcher front-runs to
exactly the edge where the victim's amountOutMin would revert. So the loss lands
precisely on the slippage setting (0.5% tolerance -> 0.5% stolen), and small
swaps are not sandwiched at all because the 0.3% fee on both legs eats the edge.
An earlier unconstrained optimizer said the searcher front-runs with the whole
reserve and takes 72% of the swap - absurd, and it would have been an
embarrassing overclaim on screen. `bestSandwich()` bisects for the revert wall.

Do NOT call this an "anti-sandwich testnet". That is the Stage-2 artifact and it
requires genuinely separated operators to mean anything. This is a playground.

## Telemetry (final run)
- divergence: n/a (execution build; spec was the approved plan)
- models: main loop + 1 explorer subagent; gates (executable) replaced skeptic panels
- claims: all DoD rows verified in-session except "CI green" (supported: same commands local)
- fleet: 1 subagent · overhead vs single-pass ≈ 1.1x
